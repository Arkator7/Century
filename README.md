## About

Century: Spice Road is the first title in the Century series of games, and is designed by Emerson Matsuuchi (Specter Ops designer). Discover the beauties of the spice trading road and its colorful markets with the amazing artwork by international renowned artist Fernanda Su√°rez. Wrap your mind around simple and pure game mechanics combined with a touch of deck-building system that lead to endless strategies and decisions.

Century: Golem Edition is a re-themed version of Century: Spice Road set in the world of Caravania. In Century: Golem Edition, players are caravan leaders who travel the famed golem road to deliver crystals to the far reaches of the world. Each turn, players perform one of four actions:

- Establish a trade route (by taking a market card)
- Make a trade or harvest crystals (by playing a card from hand)
- Fulfill a demand (by meeting a victory point card's requirements and claiming it)
- Rest (by taking back into your hand all of the cards you've played)

The last round is triggered once a player has claimed their fifth victory point card, then whoever has the most victory points wins.
